			<h1>Lab 11 - JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was for us to experiment with JavaScript and jQuery to Create an input field and with the user inputting their name for us to create an original sequence of letters based on the letters in the name.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Our group did not really have any real issues with the lab. If there were any issues, the main issue would be just grasping a bit more of an understanding of javascript due to me and my partner not coming into this class with prior coding knowledge.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab to me was very fun and felt very different than what we normally do in the class. Furthermore I found it intriguing just because it was unlike anything we've done before so far.</p>
			</div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Type out your name here for a secret and fun experiment:</p>
                <div id="secret"></div>
                <div id="output"></div>
