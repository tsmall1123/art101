			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to work with a partner to experiment with basic Javascript data types and variables.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I had no idea what document.write() did so it took some time to grasp an understanding of it. 
						Also at first I created 'year' as a string, instead of a number, 
						which screwed with the required function. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went pretty smooth. It was tough at first because I've never touched Javascript
						but once I played with it a bit I became more comfortable. I put a lot of effort into this project
					in terms of learning how to use and in general just about Javascript. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
						<p>Here are the results:</p>
					<h3>Script Output</h3>

						<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab.js"></script>
