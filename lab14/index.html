			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools and Strategies</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> the challenge for this lab was to debug any old lab assignments that had any issues or errors within their code that results in them not working as they should.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> All of our previous labs have already been done correctly thanks to the help of W3 schools and other sources like WesBot so there was no true problems that arose since we had to do basically no debugging.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I do believe that debugging is a useful tool and even though we didn't really use it in this case for this lab it's very helpful for the future coding that we will do not only for this class but in life as well.
					</p>
			</div>

				<p>Our results Are all of our previous lab work that has already been done correctly and that has fulfilled rubric requirements as well.</p>
