			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to organize the structure of our files and to become familiar with how to transfer files</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>No true problems arose for me. Mainly if there were any issues it was just ensuring that I completed each step listed in the instructions. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I put all of my effort into lab 3. I have an understanding now of howneccessary it is to make sure our file structures are organized to make the coding experience much easier and more organized. Organization sometimes for me is a struggle so this really did help. </p>
