			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to practice psuedo code and problem solving. We were assigned to use bigger tasks and in turn 
						break them down and go further in depth with them by putting them into smaller singular steps. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The challenge  in this lab for me personally was to break down such the simple game that is rock paper scissors into much smaller steps. 
						I also don't have much experience coding so it was a challenge for me to perform this function in that regard. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was very helpful in terms of how to create an outline for coding and further than that problem solving as well. When doing the instructions for creating an online rock, paper, scissors game with short code, 
						it was kind of hard to grasp an understanding of how to start it even though the game itself is very standard and very simple that basically anyone can know the rules and how to play. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<pre><code>
					Instructions for recording a song:
						// Open a DAW (Digital Audio Workspace) on your computer
						// Navigate to “create a new audio track”
						// Select yes
						// Connect an audio interface via USB-C
						// Navigate to settings and select the name of the interface for input and output
						// Navigate back to the main workstation of the DAW
						// Select “input 1” on track head
						// Toggle Record on track head
						// Connect an electric guitar via quarter-inch cable to input 1 of audio interface
						// Turn the gain knob up on the interface
						// Look at track 1 in your DAW and ensure that you are receiving about 12db of signal gain
						// Press record on the top of your DAW
						// Strum your instrument
						// Press “space” to stop recording
						// Press “space to listen back to your recording
					Instructions for online "rock paper scissors" game:
						// Print options on screen before each turn (rock, paper, and scissors)
						// Accept user input
						// Validate user input
						// Choose computer move
						// Display user and computer moves on screen
						// Test of win or draw condition
